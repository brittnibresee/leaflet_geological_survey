# leaflet_geological_survey
 In this project I was tasked with developing a way to visualize USGS data that will allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations (and hopefully secure more funding) on issues facing our planet.

## Overview
This project uses Leaflet.js to display geological survey data on a map. The data is loaded via an API and visualized using D3.js.
